# Traffic-light-control-system-for-a-intersection-using-a-GEMO-PLC-controller
This project implements a comprehensive traffic light control system for a four-way (+) intersection using a GEMO PLC controller. The system efficiently manages traffic flow through multiple operational modes and includes emergency vehicle prioritization.

## Features

-Automatic Mode: Standard timed sequence operation.

-Pedestrian Crossing: Integrated walk / don't walk signals.

-System Monitoring: Real-time status and fault detection.

## Hardware Components

-GEMO PLC Controller

-Traffic light units (Red/Yellow/Green LEDs)

-Pedestrian crossing buttons

-Power supply unit

-Emergency override switch

-System status indicators
